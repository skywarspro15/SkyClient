# SkyClient
My own Minecraft Client. All code is open-source.

--INSTALLATION--
For now, I don't have a launcher or an installer yet. But it will be added soon in the next update.

Here's how you install SkyClient into your game. 

First, download all the files.
Second, go to your Minecraft Java folder. Here's how you locate the folder:

Go to your file explorer, and type in the address bar: %appdata%
Then, you should locate the .minecraft folder. 

Now, you've located your Minecraft folder. In your Minecraft folder, locate the versions folder.
In the versions folder, move SkyClient's folder.

Now you should be good to go.
